In this application the learning objective was to learn how to test your 
javascript code programatically using jasmine. A series of tests were 
written to determine whether or not the application was functioning as 
intended. 

In order to run the app simply open the Index.html in a web browser. 

The Jasmine test results are at the bottom of the page, and outline the 
outcome of each written test.
