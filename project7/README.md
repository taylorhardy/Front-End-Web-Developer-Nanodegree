neighborhood map. 

this is a map that pinpoints areas of interest where I live. It was built using the google maps API and knockout.js. 
You are able to interact with the items on the map just like the google maps page. A search bar is also included where you
can search the names I have listed or the category that they fall under. 

In order to run the application simply open the index.html page in a web browser.
